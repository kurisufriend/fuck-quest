    <gt>>what is this?</gt><br>
    This website is a collected archive of <b>Fuck Quest</b>, a collaborative work of smut fiction that ran on 4chan from 2014 to 2022.
    There exists already an official directory for FQ and other works by its author, OP Studios, at <a href="https://op-studios.net">op-studios.net</a>, but my goal is to create a more permanent self-hosted version, with fixed images, homogenous threads, and easy navigation.

    <div class="post misc">
    <gt>>navigation</gt><br>
    All FQ threads have been saved in their original form, and are represented in imageboard format. <br>
    Each thread has a link to the next in chronological order, and each "marked" post (i.e. story-related OP post) has a link to the next. If desired, enabling "reader mode" will make all non-story/non-OP posts invisible.<br>
    <!--THE CHART has also been re-imagined (with the same information) for your viewing pleasure. -->
