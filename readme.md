current status:
    ~~imgs from /a/ are nonexistent. we have thumbnails, and only thumbnails. i'm working on it.~~
    scraped a little under a third of them from the archives because they hashmatch with something posted more recently. still working on it.


todo

* static titles
* 'next' nav buttons break if the next OP doesn't contain the next post
* save the miraheze wiki somehow. maybe bring it back as a mediawiki site.
* ~~picrel~~
    * ~~scrape down images as best we can, thumbnails and full-size if available~~
    * upgrade /a/ thumbs to real imgs via reverse searching
    * get deleted /tg/ imgs (not on suptg) from somewhere
    * total thumbs missing 277
    * current status: 97.98163800641213% low self esteem coverage (thinks thumbs are good enough)
    * 82.2427863596619% fullsize coverage
    * ~~generate thumbs for image db~~
* explode pastebin links into normal lewd dumps
    * marker 'this post used to be a pastebin link -- the content has been moved for your fapping pleasure.
* the ENTIRE SMATTERS lewd from the s1-end-OVA is not marked as such. it's not canon either, but fuck it i need dat rabbit ass
* have episode page show lewd # (?)
    * use lewd tags n stuff.
* go through the whole story myself to check QoL.
    * i'm looking forward to it

trivia:
* in s02e01 vivian mentions that one of the recent DBA interns was 'valedictorian at CalTech'. Caltech (note the single capital letter) doesn't do valedictorians, and I don't think they do class ranks at all.
