* there's one lewd at the start of s02 that isn't found because it's post s01 pre pastebin rule
* 'next' nav buttons break if the next OP doesn't contain the next post

    * marker 'this post used to be a pastebin link -- the content has been moved for your fapping pleasure.

trivia:
* in s02e01 vivian mentions that one of the recent DBA interns was 'valedictorian at CalTech'. Caltech (note the single capital letter) doesn't do valedictorians, and I don't think they do class ranks at all.
